# opengltest
This is  a small project to make a opengl engine 

Keep in mind I am a beginner with opengl and do not now much about c++

deps to compile:
  glad,
  glfw,
  gcc/g++,
  make

compile with `make` command

*note: the binary "OpenglTest" is a linux binary and will likely not work on your system*
