#

Keep in mind I am a beginner with opengl and do not know much about c++

#

### Dependencies to **compile**:
* glad,
* glfw,
* gcc/g++,
* make

#

compile with `make` command

#

*note: the preincluded binary "OpenglTest" is a linux binary*

*note: this project as of the 6th of Jully 2021 uses core profile version 3.3*

#

**Todo:**
* Make a simple 3D object
* Use cmake instead of make



* ~~Add Windows binary and a mac binary (although apple deprecated opengl and will likely remove it)~~
*Why remove this todo?*

I believe there is little reason to create an extra binary for mac and windows that will help improve the engine. Though, if I find an interest again I will try.
